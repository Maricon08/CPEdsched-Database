# credentials Table

## Purpose
Stores student credential verification records in the PUP College of Engineering Computer Engineering Laboratory system. This table manages the Certificate of Registration (COR) upload and verification process, tracking document submissions, approval status, expiration dates, and admin verification history. It ensures that only verified students with valid enrollment can access laboratory facilities and equipment.
